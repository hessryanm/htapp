-Using the console seems impossible. Nothing is defined. How do I get this to work?

1. Set the current companionship ID as a variable.
2. Check if that variable equals the current companionship id
3. If not, reset the variable to the current companionship id.
4. Then filter by that companionship id?

Angular things to learn:
-Filter
-orderBy
-Repeat
-Bindings
-Directives
-Services

1) Modules:
	a. Should my entire app have one module, or a separate module for each major feature area?

	b. Do I have just one router for the entire app? Or are those often split up as well?

2) Controllers:
	a. It looks like I should have a seprate controller for each page that has a unique URL (since I can specify in the router which template and controller to use). My question is: do I keep all controllers in one file, or do I put each module in its own controller file?

	b. It semms like a controller is essentially the javascript for a specific page. Is that a good basic analogy?
